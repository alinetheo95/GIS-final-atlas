                <p>The New York City grid originated from the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which put in place the rectilinear grid plan. This was cheaper and more efficient for development and expansion, maximizing sellable rectangular lots. Although this map showed a masterplan for the entire city, it took years for this to actually be built. The grid was built in phases, working from the South to the North.</p>

                <p>Today, New York City's land coverage is approximately 72% impervious. Not only does this restrict organic pathways and desire lines, it also restricts movement and growth of ecological habitats. Lack of permeable surfaces is also causing harsh conditions due to climate change, such as urban heat island effect and increased flooding.</p>

                <p>Manhattan was once crisscrossed by dozens of freshwater streams and creeks that flowed from central hills to both rivers. While most were buried during development and now exist as underground storm sewers, many still flow beneath city streets—occasionally making their presence known during heavy rains when they flood basements and subway tunnels.</p>
