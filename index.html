                <p>Today, New York City's land coverage is approximately 72% impervious. Not only does this restrict organic pathways and desire lines, it also restricts movement and growth of ecological habitats. Lack of permeable surfaces is also causing harsh conditions due to climate change, such as urban heat island effect and increased flooding.</p>

                <p>Manhattan was once crisscrossed by dozens of freshwater streams and creeks that flowed from central hills to both rivers. While most were buried during development and now exist as underground storm sewers, many still flow beneath city streets—occasionally making their presence known during heavy rains when they flood basements and subway tunnels.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately due to New York City's urban density, we've lost a lot of the ecological corridors and interconnectivity of natural elements. Although we have street trees and parks scattered throughout the city, the high impervious surface coverage inhibits the development of the vast root network system that exists in forests. Known as the mycorrhizal network, this root system is beneficial in facilitating the exchange of resources between plants, improving soil health, and enhancing plant protection and communication.</p>

From the human perspective, it is hard to disconnect from the overwhelmingly dense and rigid infrastructure.

These would be moments in which the dense urban environment becomes unrecognizable. This is the starting point in which the city becomes natural again. </p>
